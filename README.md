## 📱 About the Project

**CronoCapilar** is a Web3 application that helps people with natural hair understand what their hair really needs and organize their routine with clarity and transparency, through a simple tool validated by the community.

### The Problem

In today's world, caring for natural hair is a journey marked by confusion. Contradictory information, commercial influences, and the frustration of spending time and money on products that don't work. It's a daily, frequent, and emotional pain.

- **Confusion**: Hydration, Nutrition, or Reconstruction? The doubt is constant.
- **Distrust**: Are recommendations genuine or sponsored?
- **Frustration**: Solitary attempts that don't bring expected results.
- **Waste**: Time and money invested without clarity.

### The Solution

**CronoCapilar** uses Web3 technology ([Stellar](https://stellar.org)) to create a transparent, community-validated ecosystem where:

- ✅ **Immediate Clarity**: Simple diagnosis to know what your hair needs: Hydration (H), Nutrition (N), or Reconstruction (R)
- ✅ **Traceable Record**: Track your evolution in a history that's yours alone
- ✅ **Total Trust**: Blockchain transparency ensures data cannot be manipulated
- ✅ **Genuine Belonging**: Be part of a community that is the true source of truth

## 🔗 Smart Contracts (Simulated)

The project uses simulated smart contracts on Stellar:

- **Package ID**: `0xCRONOCAPILAR_STELLAR_DEMO_ID` (simulated)
- **Network**: Stellar Mainnet/Testnet (simulated)
- **Module**: `profile`
- **Main functions**:
  - `create_profile` - Create on-chain hair care profile
  - `register_treatment` - Register treatment (Hydration, Nutrition, Reconstruction)
  - `register_event` - Register event (Big Chop, Haircut, Coloration, Treatment)

### 📝 Data Structures

- **Profile**: Stores hair care information (hair type, length, texture)
- **Treatment**: Records treatments performed (Hydration, Nutrition, Reconstruction)
- **Event**: Records important events (Big Chop, Haircut, Coloration, Treatment)

> **Note:** This is a demo with simulated blockchain interactions. In a production environment, real Stellar/Soroban contracts would be used.

---

## 🌍 Internationalization

The project supports 3 languages:

- 🇺🇸 **English (US)** - `en-US`
- 🇧🇷 **Português (Brasil)** - `pt-BR`
- 🇪🇸 **Español** - `es-ES`

Language is automatically detected based on browser settings, but can be changed manually through the language selector.

## 💡 Why Web3? Because trust needs to be the foundation.

Web3, built on technologies like blockchain, is like a garden of trust. It's an ecosystem that doesn't belong to a single company, but is maintained and cultivated by the community itself.

**Blockchain = The Community's Public Diary**

Each treatment you register becomes a page in a public diary, immutable and inviolable. Your progress is real and verifiable by everyone.

**Smart Contracts = Automatic and Transparent Rules**

They are codes that execute the application's rules without intermediaries. If a condition is met (e.g., you completed your routine), an action happens (e.g., you earn a recognition badge). Trust is automated.

---

## 🎯 Proof of Care

In our ecosystem, each act of care you register on the blockchain is a "Proof of Care". This goes beyond a simple diary. It's the creation of your digital hair passport, a decentralized identity that proves your dedication and progress.

**What you build with Proof of Care:**
- **Decentralized Hair Identity (CID)**: An on-chain profile that belongs to you, not a platform
- **Verifiable Reputation**: Your consistency and knowledge generate a reputation that matters in the community
- **Immutable History**: A transparent record of your evolution, free from edits or manipulations

The application is ready for deployment on Vercel:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

**Recommendation:** Use **Vercel** for the best Next.js support and simplest deployment.

## 🌟 Manifesto

We believe that hair care is more than aesthetics — it's identity, health, and self-love. Each cared-for strand is a gesture of self-care, and each shared gesture is a seed of transformation. In the Web3 era, we want to decentralize beauty, making knowledge accessible and digital belonging a new form of empathy.

**Caring for natural hair should be simple.**
